    Question: "Which of the following is a good way to input n space separated integers in Python?",
    Answer: "Lis1 = list(map(int, input().split()))",
    Distractor1: "Lis1 = input().split()",
    Distractor2: "Lis1 = int(input())",
    Distractor3: "Lis3 = list(map(int, input().split()))",
    Explaination: map function in python makes the items of a list directly into intiger form while in input().split() the intigers will be added in string format.
